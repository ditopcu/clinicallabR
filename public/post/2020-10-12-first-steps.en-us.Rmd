Let's start with calculating mean, SD and CV for glucose IQC Level 1

```{r}

# Some arbitrary glucose IQC results --> Level 1

glucose_L1 <- c(101, 111, 103, 98, 100, 106, 103, 94, 90, 102, 98, 100, 97, 107, 98, 106, 107, 87, 100, 107)

# We are creating variable named "glucose_mean_L1" and assigning calculated mean to this variable
glucose_L1_mean <- mean(glucose_L1)

#print Mean
glucose_L1_mean

# We are creating variable named "glucos_sd_L1" and assigning calculated SD  to this variable
glucos_L1_sd <- sd(glucose_L1)
#print SD
glucos_L1_sd

#Now Calculate CV = sd/mean*100

glucose_L1_CV <- (glucos_L1_sd / glucose_L1_mean) * 100 


```



```{r}


```


Glucose mean  is **`r glucose_L1_mean`** mg/dL.  
SD  is **`r glucos_L1_sd`** mg/dL and   
CV is **`r glucose_L1_CV`** .
